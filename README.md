# The Great British Code Off

### Computing isn't my forte, but baking and cake is...


<p>Personally, I have always struggled with understanding the world of code and computers; I’ve found it a place filled with jargon that enjoys flying straight over my head, and technical processes in which I could never become fluid. Therefore, in order for me to gain insight during this project, I needed to make meaningful comparisons between something I knew I understood, and computing. For me, I could find ample relevant examples connecting computer software and the art of baking, which is something I happen to have a lot of knowledge in. Our media is creative computing after all, so I took a unique, individual, and creative approach.

<p>The actual term of ‘Open-Sourcing’ wasn’t created until the 1980s; but in the 1950s and 1960s, source code, the human-readable form of software, was distributed with the site, providing ability to change, delete and add new functions to existing codes. The source code acts in a similar way to a recipe, showing all the ingredients to make the software the code belongs to. The source code is laid out line by line, resembling a step-by-step instruction ‘recipe’ to ‘cook’ the finished site. Most people enjoy the finished software, in a similar way to an eccentrically decorated cake, but consider less the laborious process in which it took to get there. The source code is accessible for the public to see this process and see the work the creator did to get to the product to distribute and share for evolvement. 
</p>

<p>Some software has source code that only the person, team, or organization who created it can modify exclusively; a secret recipe only trusted individuals are allowed to learn. People call this kind of software "proprietary" or "closed source" software. This somewhat inhibits the ability for ‘hackers’ to corrupt or misuse the information. This is where my comparisons can’t quite match between the art of code and baking, as copying someone’s recipe or stealing someone’s custard cannot lead to such dire consequences like the meddling of extensively intricate coding. There are examples of ‘meddling’ with code in history which have aided us, such as the Enigma Machine1; but there’s also been incidents that have been close to detrimental, for example Matthew Bevan and Richard Pryce2, who almost started a World War III in 1996 by dumping Korean Atomic Research Institute (KARI) information onto American military systems. These examples provide insight into the pros and cons of having access to source code.
</p>

<p>There are many real-life examples of companies taking inspiration from the code and concepts of other rivals due to ‘open sourcing’. This a concept comparable in baking, for example the controversy of the famous ‘Colin the Caterpillar Cake’, made originally by Marks and Spencer, being stolen, and developed by almost every other British supermarket brand due to its popularity. An example in coding and software is the creation of ‘stories’3 by Instagram, originally made popular on the social media site ‘Snapchat’. It is highly likely that ‘stories’ wouldn’t have been developed by Instagram if their owner Facebook hadn’t bought out Snapchat for $3 billion prior to this software development on the Instagram site. This ‘copy-cat’ approach of creating Instagram stories shows a successful new evolvement of another brand’s software, as it brought 250 million more users in that year.
